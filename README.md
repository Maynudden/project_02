What the Project Does
This project is a simple password strength checker that gives visual feedback on whether the entered password is strong or weak based on its length. It uses HTML and CSS only — no JavaScript — and changes the color bar and feedback message depending on whether the password meets a minimum length.

Tools and Languages Used
HTML5 – to structure the web page

CSS3 – to style the elements and create visual feedback

Steps to Build and Run the Project
Create a Project Folder
Make a folder named password-strength-checker.

Create HTML File
Inside the folder, create a file named index.html and paste the HTML code provided earlier.

Create CSS File
Create another file named style.css and paste the CSS code.

Link CSS to HTML
Make sure your <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" /> is in the <head> of your HTML file.

Run the Project
Open index.html in any web browser. Try entering passwords — you’ll see the bar and text change when the password has 8 or more characters.

Key Features:
1) Fully functional without JavaScript

2) Responsive design for mobile and desktop

3) Dynamic feedback using :valid and :invalid CSS pseudo-classes

4) Minimum password length check via HTML5 pattern attribute

5) User-friendly UI with animations and colors
